#Objective: Build a data-driven Fantasy XI Optimizer

Today was all about translating insights into real impact — like how professional teams or fantasy apps build their match-winning lineups.

✅ We began by merging player stats with pitch behavior and style ✅ Predicted fantasy points using machine learning ✅ Used linear programming to select the best XI under 100 credits ✅ Ensured the ideal role balance (5 batters incl. 1 WK, 4 bowlers, 2 all-rounders) ✅ Visualized the final XI by predicted points and credits

It felt like being a real match analyst — every player had to earn their place.

Key Takeaways:

Sports analytics is more than numbers — it’s strategic decision-making

Constraint-based optimization is incredibly powerful in fantasy and team selection

Pitch-aware, role-specific team builds can massively boost fantasy scores
